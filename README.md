# DarkDuels

  Dark Duels is a board game that I started designing in Feb 2017 and after continuous rounds of playtesting with friends, was able to reach a balanced version of the game on Dec 21st, 2017. Since then, I've been trying to learn how to use Unity and develop it into a multiplayer video game.

# About the game

  Trading card games like MTG or Yu-Gi-Oh! are highly inaccessible for new players because of the high amount of commitment required outside of the game. Players have to spend a lot of money buying cards and then spend a lot of time constructing decks from the cards in their collections. Also, the player that has invested more time and money on their deck will be at an advantage before the game even starts. This is fine for a certain demographic of players, perhaps for those below the age of 20, who have lots of time on their hands. But for adults who might enjoy playing these games casually, there is no game out there that replicates the experience of playing a TCG in a casual format. 
  
  Enter Dark Duels.
